=================================
BiCon - The Bidirectional Console
=================================

This is the bidirectional console as presented by Arabeyes.

Installation
------------

You need the fribidi library to compile this program. Probably
you have it in your distribution. If not, get it from
http://fribidi.sourceforge.net

Installation is simple, the usual steps:
	./configure
	make
	make install

Usage
-----

This program is not currently usable under X. In fact, it is only
usable under the Linux console.

Simply run "bicon" to get a console supporting Arabic or Persian.
The language used is chosen according to the LANG environment
variable.

You can also choose the language country by specifying the country on
the country on the command line, e.g ::

	bicon sa          # enables Arabic (Saudi Arabia) support
	bicon ir          # for Persian(Iran)

Of course, you have a man page bicon(1) to check.
