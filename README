=================================
BiCon - The Bidirectional Console
=================================

This is the bidirectional console as presented by Arabeyes.

Installation
------------
You need the fribidi library to compile this program. Probably you have it in your distribution. If not, get it from http://fribidi.sourceforge.net

Installation is simple, the usual::
	./configure
	make
	make install

steps.

Usage
-----
This program is ot currently usable under X. In fact, it is only usable under the Linux (*BSD?) console.

Simply run "abicon" to get a console supporting Arabic or Persian. The language used is chosen according to the LANG environment variable.

Run "abicon ar" to get Arabic support, or "abicon fa" for Persian.

Of course, you have a man page abicon(1) to check.
