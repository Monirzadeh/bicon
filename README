=================================
BiCon - The Bidirectional Console
=================================

This is the bidirectional console as presented by Arabeyes.

Installation
------------

You need the fribidi library to compile this program. Probably
you have it in your distribution. If not, get it from
http://fribidi.sourceforge.net

Installation is simple, the usual::
	./configure
	make
	make install

steps.

Usage
-----

This program is not currently usable under X. In fact, it is only
usable under the Linux console.

Simply run "bicon_console" to get a console supporting Arabic or
Persian. The language used is chosen according to the LANG
environment variable.

You can also choose the language country by specifying the country on
the country on the command line, e.g ::

	bicon_console sa          # enables Arabic (Saudi Arabia) support
	bicon_console ir          # for Persian(Iran)

Of course, you have a man page bicon_console(1) to check.
