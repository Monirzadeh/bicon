You need FriBidi library installed to use this package. get it from
  http://fribidi.sf.net/

To make, just run `make' at command line.

Currently you can use this package just under linux console.

To run a command, with bidi enabled console, run "./bin/farsi [cmd param ...]",
if no cmd is passed, /bin/sh is used.

To lookup an english word with http://bamdad.org/dict's english-persian
dictionary, run "./bin/farsidict word"

To findout what's going on, run these commands:

#---- script start ----
	# set keyboard mode to unicode
kbd_mode -u

	# load persian keyboard map
loadkeys keymap/isiri2901.kmap.gz
	# you can switch between languages with left-alt + left-shift

	# load the font
consolechars -f font/farsi-8x16-512.psf.gz
	# put console in utf-8 mode
echo -ne "\033%G"

	# pass the utf8 file through vuconsole filter
fconsole/vuconsole test.utf8/hafez
	# you should see the first hafez sonnet

	# run fcon filter to get a bidi enabled shell
fcon/fcon
	# now, you are in a bidi enabled shell

	# you should type these in the new shell
cat testtexts/hafez
	# you should see the same sonnet

	# and this one is an arabic example
cat testtexts/fatiha
	# amazing, not?

	# switch to persian, type some letters and enjoy
	# then switch back to english

	# quit fcon shell
exit

	# load system's default font
consolechars -d

	# load system's default keyboard map
loadkeys -d

	# set keyboard mode to ascii
kbd_mode -a

	# done
#---- script end ----
